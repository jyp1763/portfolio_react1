#Portfolio_react1
This react application is just a start to my ever growing portfolio. Upon loading, users will notice a navigation bar that allows them to go directly to different areas of the portfolio, such as, About, Work,Skills, and a contact page that allows users to contact me! There are links to my projects to the live sites as well as to the github pages that host the code.

This application can be started using npm start. you will then be directed to the local host page where the application will run.
